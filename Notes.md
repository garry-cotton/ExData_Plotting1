### General Notes

- You will need to download the data exdata_data_household_power_consumption.zip and extract the text file inside to the *same folder as where the R scripts are located*.
- Each R script should generate a .png file with the same name and matching the .png images found in this repo.
- The scripts will need to install packages data.table, dplyr and lubridate.
